# Catstagram

A Instagram clone made by a human for cats.
Technologies used:

- React Native for the App
- Expo
- Express.js for the backend

The main idea is to keep it working on both Android and IOS, and maybe in a future, a web page made in React for the PC browsers.

## Why?

I'm making this App to test my skills as a fullstack developer.
